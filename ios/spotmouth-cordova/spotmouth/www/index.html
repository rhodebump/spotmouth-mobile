        <p>spotmouth will allow you to view the information that others have thought was important about where you are
            at.</p>

        <p>spotmouth is just a fun idea that a Pittsburgh native had.</p>

        <p>spotmouth allows folks to easily get interesting information based upon where they are and what their
            interests are.
            It also does this while respecting privacy. You won't see posts on facebook of what you are doing.</p>

        <p>spotmouth does this by obtaining an address (from your mobile device or by you typing it in).
            It will perform a search based upon your location and display nearby marks.
            In addition to viewing the marks that others have left, you are only 4 clicks from leaving your own mark.
            Choose "MENU" at the top, choose the "Leave Mark" button and choose your spot, then leave your mark! </p>

        <p>Spotmouth allows user to "mark" spots with images, videos, audio files and text. Spotmouth uses your location
            to determine what spots to show you.</p>

        <p>spots are places (like color me mine), or license plates (as on cars), or just where you happen to be (in the
            woods,or on a river) </p>

        <p>Each spot can have one or more "groups". For example, there could be "Schenley High School" which would be a
            spot, and for this spot there could be a bunch of groups such as "Chess Club", "Swim Team" Anybody can
            create a group at any spot. The person who creates the group can control how the group is run.
            For example, the group can be public and anyone can join, or it can require approval to join.</p>
        One users are part of a group, any messages sent to the group will be sent to that person. Messages are sent via
        email, SMS messaging, the spotmouth website, or the spotmouth mobile applications.
        <p>You can choose to leave a mark on any of these different types of things by either going to the spot detail
            page, or by going to the menu. </p>

        <p>Another feature of spotmouth is the ability to send messages to your friends and family. When you signin, you
            will be able to create groups to hold your different types of friends and send them messages. For example,
            you can create a "best friends", or "work friends" groups. </p>

        <p>As a spotowner, you can use spotmouth to describe your business, hours, address, create coupons, and events
            and much more.</p>
